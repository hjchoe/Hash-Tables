This Java program implements a hash table with linear probing.
It includes classes for DataItem, which represents a data item with a key; and HashTable, which represents the hash table with methods for inserting, deleting, finding, and displaying data items.
The hash table uses linear probing for collision resolution.
It also includes functionality for checking the load factor and rehashing if the load factor exceeds a certain threshold.
The program provides a user interface for interacting with the hash table, allowing the user to insert, delete, find, and display data items.
The program is designed to be run from the command line and requires user input for operations on the hash table.
